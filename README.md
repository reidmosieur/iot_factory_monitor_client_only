# Industrial IoT Telemetry Dashboard

A real-time manufacturing telemetry dashboard built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Vercel**.  
Simulates how aerospace and industrial SaaS platforms monitor machine health across a production line.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Live Telemetry Simulation**  
  Machines broadcast data every second (temperature, vibration, torque, RPM, etc.), updating gauges + charts in real time.

- **Rolling 30s Line Charts**  
  Each sensor shows the last 30 seconds of readings, providing a short-term historical view of machine health.

- **Machine States**  
  Machines can be `Operational`, `Idle`, `Maintenance`, `Faulty`, or `Offline` with automatic color-coded alerts.

- **Multi-Machine Support**  
  The dashboard tracks multiple machines simultaneously across a factory line.

- **Portfolio-Ready Simulation**  
  All telemetry is dummy data, generated client-side. No external brokers or APIs required.
